# audiovisualizer
Experiments with audio and visualizations
demo: https://tob.github.io/audiovisualizer/

Audiovisuals based on microphone input. 
Tested only on Chrome.

Doesn't require server, it's plain javascript and very little html.

startDrawing.js is where the drawing actually happens so start from there. 
Every frame the setting layers are inspected to define the values of the shapes to draw.
